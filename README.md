# Initial-Stages-of-Data-Analysis-Using-SQL-A-Case-Study-on-Layoff-Data
The initial stage of data analysis is crucial for ensuring data quality, integrity, and readiness for advanced analytical procedures. This project shows SQL-based methodology for performing the initial stages of data analysis. Guided by seven diagnostic questions, the analysis examines the dataset’s structure, completeness, consistency, and statistical properties. Through systematic query based operations—such as data inspection, type verification, missing value handling, deduplication, categorical normalisation, and mathematical profiling the study demonstrates how SQL serves as a precise and efficient tool for foundational data preprocessing. 

## The seven questions that play their role in the early phases of data preparation due to their efficiency in querying, modifying, and auditing large datasets.
1. How does this data look like and take a backup of the data?
2. How big is this data?
3. What is the data type of column?
4. Are there any missing values?
5. Are there any duplicate values?
6. Find and normalize values that have the same meaning but different forms.
7. How does the data look like mathematically?
